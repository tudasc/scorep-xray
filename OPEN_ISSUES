                        Score-P new OPEN ISSUES
                        ========================
                                                           Status: April 2014
* CUDA support

  - CUDA device activities get lost for CUDA 5.5 (CUPTI 4). The last activity
    in a CUPTI activity buffer gets lost, when the buffer is full. The issue
    can be avoided by providing buffers, which are large enough to store all
    CUDA device activities until the buffer is flushed. The user can specify
    the CUPTI activity buffer (chunk) size with the environment variable
    SCOREP_CUDA_BUFFER_CHUNK. In CUDA 6.0 (CUPTI 5) this issue is fixed.

* OpenMP support

  - On K Computer and Fujitsu FX10 systems, some C++ OpenMP programs
    crash for unknown reason during measurement initialization when
    accessing an OpenMP threadprivate variable.

* Compiler instrumentation

  - The Intel compiler provides the function name and the source code location
    in one string separated by a colon. Thus, if the path name of the source
    code file or the function name contains colons, Score-P might split
    the source file name and the function name improperly.


                        Score-P v1.2 OPEN ISSUES
                        ========================
                                                           Status: Feb 2014

This file lists known limitations and unimplemented features of
various Score-P components.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Platform support

  - Score-P has been tested on the following platforms:
    + IBM Blue Gene/Q, only static libraries supported
    + IBM SP & BladeCenter clusters, only static libraries supported
    + Cray XE, XK, XC, only static libraries supported
    + SGI Altix/ICE
    + various Linux/Intel (x86/x64) clusters
    The provided configure options (see INSTALL) may provide a good
    basis for building and testing the toolset on other systems.

  - The following platforms have not been tested recently:
    + IBM Blue Gene/P
    + Cray XT
    + Sun Solaris/SPARC-based clusters
    However the supplied buildsystem might still work on these
    systems.

  - The following platforms have not been tested:
    + NEC SX-9
    + IBM Blue Gene/L
    + SiCortex systems
    + other NEC SX systems

  - Each toolset installation can only support one MPI implementation
    (because MPI is only source-code but not binary compatible). If
    your systems support more than one MPI implementation (e.g. Linux
    clusters often do), separate builds for each MPI implementation
    have to be installed.

  - The same is true if your system features more than one compiler
    supporting automatic function instrumentation.

  - To build Score-P it is required to have Fortran compilers and
    highly recommended to have MPI compilers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Automatic compiler instrumentation via "scorep" based on (often
  undocumented) compiler switches

  - GNU    : tested with GCC 4 and higher
  - PGI    : tested with version 10.1 and higher
             Note that PGI 13.8 is currently not supported as it is not
             recognized as an PGI compiler anymore
  - Oracle : only works for Fortran (not C/C++), tested with version 12.2
  - IBM    : only works for xlc/xlC version 7.0 and xlf version 9.1 and
             higher and corresponding bgxl compilers on BlueGene systems
  - Intel  : only works with Intel icc/ifort version 10 and higher compilers
  - Cray   : tested with version 8.1.8

  - Because the compiler instrumentation interface of the XL compiler series
    changed with xlc 11.1/xlf 13.1. You need a separate installations
    for older versions than xlc 11.1/xlf 13.1 and newer versions.

  - Measurement filtering can only be applied to functions
    instrumented by the IBM, GNU, Intel, PGI, or Oracle compilers as
    well as functions instrumented by PDT and user
    functions. (Filtering of MPI functions, OpenMP is always
    ineffective.)

  - The GNU Fortran compiler versions 4.6.0 and 4.6.1 have a bug which
    leads to an internal compiler error when using automatic function
    instrumentation.  It is therefore recommended to either use an
    older/newer version of the compiler or to work around this issue
    by using manual instrumentation or automatic source-code
    instrumentation based on PDToolkit.

  - On systems where libiberty is build without -fPIC, one cannot use
    libbdfd for compiler instrumentation's region naming (GNU, Intel,
    Cray) in --enable-shared builds of Score-P. Either provide a
    libbdfd that comes with a proper libiberty (--with-libbfd) or
    disable libbfd region naming (--without-libbfd). In the latter
    case, region names will be provided by nm.

  - The GNU compiler instrumentation provides only functions pointers, which
    we look up in the symbol table of the executable. Thus, functions from
    shared libraries, will not appear (are automatically filtered) in the
    measurement output.

  - The pgCC compiler versions 13.9 and higher preinclude omp.h for OpenMP
    codes. This results in  multiply defined symbols if the source file
    is preprocessed before compilation. Since version 14.1 an option is available
    to avoid preinclusion, which we can use for preprocessed source files.
    For the pgCC versions 13.9 until 14.0, preprocessing is not possible
    for C++ codes.

  - The GCC compiler uses DWARF v4 as the default debug information format
    since version 4.8. But when used with an older binutils version this
    results in unreliably region meta data. If file name information are
    missing in the resulting region meta data, than try recompiling with
    the -gdwarf-3 or -gdwarf-2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* MPI support

  - When using derived data types in non-blocking communications, and
    no support for MPI_Type_dup() was detected, then please ensure,
    that the MPI_Datatype handle is still valid at the time the
    request finishes.

  - Online detection of MPI wait states might produce wrong results
    when messages sent within different communicators overtake each
    other.

  - Currently, Score-P can't handle MPI_Finalize() calls that occur
    after the end of main(), e.g., via a destructor of a static C++
    object. Please call MPI_Finalize() before the end of main(). The
    issue will be resolved in a future version of Score-P.

  - If an application uses MPI inter-communicators, Score-P
    measurement will hang during the creation of the communicator.

  - The IBM Platform MPI (not mpixlc!) compiler wrapper (the formerly
    HP-MPI) does not append its libraries at the very end of the
    original link command. Thus, instrumenting applications with
    Score-P fails at link time due to unresolved symbols in the
    Score-P libraries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* OpenMP support

  - Function instrumentation using the Intel compiler version 11.1 for
    codes using OpenMP tasking is erroneous. You might try PDT
    instrumentation instead.

  - OpenMP tasking: On Exits, the PGI compiler instrumentation
    interface does not provide information which function was
    exited. Thus, we reconstruct this information from a call stack
    inside the compiler adapter. However, if the instrumented
    application uses tasks, the enter/exit event sequence for a thread
    may not be nested anymore, due to interleaved execution of
    tasks. This results in incorrect region handles on exit events
    which may lead to errors in the profiling algorithm or errors in
    analysis tools. Thus, we recommend to no use PGI compiler
    instrumentation together with applications using tasks. You may
    try PDT instrumentation instead.

  - Currently, the instrumenter allows to switch off OPARI2
    instrumentation for OpenMP programs. If OpenMP parallel regions
    are not instrumented and an event occures inside a parallel region
    (e.g., because an instrumented function is called inside of a
    parallel region) Score-P will crash. We are considering to make
    the usage more secure in future versions of Score-P. This might
    result in a change of the instrumenter option or the option may
    vanish completely. However, there are some use-cases where
    disabling OPARI2 instrumentation is helpful.

  - Due to a bug in the Cray compilers OpenMP instrumentation is
    broken if an OpenMP parallel pragma is used in combination with
    an if clause.

 - OPARI2-instrumented Fortran OpenMP codes that use compiler options
   to change the default name-mangling (XL compilers: -qextname, GNU:
   -fno-underscoring' and '-fsecond-underscore') will likely crash.
   This is because a variable name used in the Score-P libraries does
   not match the one instrumented by OPARI2. On AIX, a workaround is
   to manusally rename it at link time (-brename:pomp_tpd_,pomp_tpd).

 - With PGI C++ v13.10 compiler, preprocessing of OpenMP codes using
   OPARI2 is not possible any longer as the compiler itself adds a
   '--preinclude omp.h' option to the call of pgcpp1. This leads to
   'invalid redeclaration' errors. As a workaround, use the
   '--nopreprocess' instrumenter option.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Score-P misc.

  - There might be a performance impact when instrumenting code without
    explicitly given optimization flags. The instrumenter adds compiler
    flags to enable additional debugging information. Depending on the
    compiler this may turn off optimization unless optimization flags
    are explicitly specified.

  - Applications using an autotools-based buildsystem should add the
    option "--disable-option-checking" to the usual configure
    call. Score-P is added only at make time like "make CC="scorep
    <your-CC>" (same for CXX, F77, and FC)

  - Literal file-filter rules like "INCLUDE bt.f" for Fortran files that
    will be processed by OPARI2 (i.e., files containing OpenMP or POMP
    user pragmas) do not work as expected as OPARI2 changes the file
    name (here to bt.opari.f)

  - Due to a bug in PDT 3.18 and earlier versions, PDT support is
    disabled on BlueGene systems.

  - Rusage-based metrics are not supported on BlueGene systems.

  - Using scorep as a compiler/linker preposition is sometimes not
    supported by application build systems, e.g., CMake.  In such
    cases, it may be appropriate to create scripts which invoke the
    compiler/linker with the scorep preposition defined.  For example,
    specify scorep_ftn as the compiler and linker during application
    configuration, where this is a script executing your Fortran
    compiler as "scorep ftn $*".

  - COBI binary instrumentation is currently disabled due to changes
    in Score-P's linking process that now passes more libraries to
    COBI/Dyninst than it can handle at the moment. This issue
    will be addressed in a future release of Score-P and/or Dyninst.

  - Traces generated by applications compiled with the CCE Fortran
    compiler on Cray X series systems are inconsistent as there is no
    exit event for 'main'. I.e., such traces are not analyzable by
    Scalasca.

  - Running make check fails if SCOREP_EXPERIMENT_DIRECTORY is set to
    'scorep'. One workaround is to run
    '(unset SCOREP_EXPERIMENT_DIRECTORY; make check;)'.
