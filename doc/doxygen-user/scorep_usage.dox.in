This is the Score-P instrumentation tool. The usage is:
scorep <options> <original command>

Common options are:
  --help, -h      Show help output. Does not execute any other command.
  --config=<file> Specifies file for the instrumentation configuration.
  -v, --verbose[=<value>] Specifies the verbosity level. The following
                  levels are available:
                  0 = No output
                  1 = Executed commands are displayed (default if no
                      value is specified)
                  2 = Detailed information is displayed
  --dry-run       Only displays the executed commands. It does not
                  execute any command.
  --keep-files    Do not delete temporarily created files after successfull
                  instrumentation. By default, temporary files are deleted
                  if no error occures during instrumentation.
  --version       Prints the Score-P version and exits.
  --static        Enforce static linking of the Score-P libraries.
  --dynamic       Enforce dynamic linking of the Score-P libraries.
  --no-as-needed  Adds a GNU ld linker flag to fix undefined references
                  when using shared Score-P libraries. This happens on
                  systems using --as-needed as linker default. It will
                  be handled transparently in future releases of Score-P.
  --thread=<paradigm>[:<variant>]
                  Possible paradigms and variants are:
              none
                  No thread support.
              omp:pomp_tpd
                  OpenMP support using OPARI2 thread tracking
                  It requires and, thus, automatically enables opari instrumentation.
              omp:ancestry
                  OpenMP support using thread tracking with ancestry functions in OpenMP 3.0 and later
                  It requires and, thus, automatically enables opari instrumentation.
  --mpp=<paradigm>[:<variant>]
                  Possible paradigms and variants are:
              none
                  No multi-process support.
              mpi
                  MPI support using library wrapping
  --mutex=<paradigm>[:<variant>]
                  Possible paradigms and variants are:
              none
                  serial case, no locking
              pthread
                  Pthread mutex locks
              pthread:spinlock
                  Pthread spinlocks
              omp
                  OpenMP locks
  --nocobi        Disables cobi instrumentation.
  --compiler      Enables compiler instrumentation.
                  By default, it disables cobi and pdt instrumentation.
  --nocompiler    Disables compiler instrumentation.
  --nocuda        Disables cuda instrumentation.
  --online-access Enables online-access support. It is disabled by default
  --noonline-access online-access Disables online-access support.
  --pomp[=<paramter-list>]
                  Enables pomp user instrumentation.
                  You may add additional parameters that are passed to OPARI2.
                  By default, it enables also preprocessing
  --nopomp        Disables pomp user instrumentation.
  --opari[=<paramter-list>]
                  Enables OPARI2 instrumentation of OpenMP regions.
                  You may add additional parameters that are passed to OPARI2
                  By default, it enables also preprocessing and
                  pomp user instrumentation.
  --pdt[=<paramter-list>]
                  Enables pdt instrumentation.
                  You may add additional parameters that are passed to pdt.
                  It requires and, thus, automatically enables user instrumentation.
                  It conflicts and, thus, automatically disables preprocess instrumentation.
                  By default, it disables cobi and compiler instrumentation.
  --nopdt         Disables pdt instrumentation.
  --preprocess    Enables preprocess instrumentation.
                  It requires and, thus, automatically enables opari instrumentation.
                  It conflicts and, thus, automatically disables pdt instrumentation.
  --nopreprocess  Disables preprocess instrumentation.
  --user          Enables user instrumentation.
  --nouser        Disables user instrumentation.
