------------------- Upcoming version 1.3 -----------------------------

------------------- Upcoming version 1.2.1 ---------------------------

- Allow configuration without support for the MPI programming model by
  specifying --without-mpi on the configure line.
- On Blue Gene/Q, detect PAMI library at configure time. The loaction and
  names of the PAMI files changes during a system upgrade. Search all known
  directories and library names.
- On SGI MPT systems, or more generally on systems that don't use
  compiler wrappers for building MPI programs, improve the automatic
  detection of the MPI programming paradigm during instrumentation.

------------------- Released version 1.2 -----------------------------

- Simplified MPI compiler detection, passing '--with-mpi' to configure
  is usually not necessary if your MPI compiler is in PATH.
- Support for Cray systems. PrgEnv-(cray|gnu|intel|pgi) are supported
  in static mode (static is the default). Please note that OpenMP
  instrumentation is currently broken for PrgEnv-cray.
- Compilation units getting processed by OPARI2 are now being
  preprocessed by the C/C++ preprocessor. This way it is possible to
  instrument OpenMP directives in header files. It also solves
  instrumentation problems cause by OpenMP pragmas within preprocessor
  defines. Preprocessing is the default but can be deactivated using
  --nopreprocess. When using PDT instrumentation, preprocessing is
  deactivated.
- To reduce the memory demands of dynamic regions in profiling mode,
  this version provides a lossy compression mechanism called
  'clustering'; similar subtrees of a dynamic region are clustered
  into one. This feature is enabled by default. There are three new
  environment variables for customization, please see the documentation
  for details.
- The new keyword 'MANGLED' was added to the filter file format to
  deal with cases where the displayed name and mangled name are
  different.
- External metric sources can be utilized via a a plug-in mechanism. 
  This feature is controlled via the SCOREP_METRIC_PLUGIN environment
  variable. Please see the documentation for details and an example.
- The CUDA adapter got refactored and extended to provide much more
  useful metrics. There are several new values to the environment
  variable SCOREP_CUDA_ENABLE. Please see the documentation for
  details.
- The machine name used in the profile and trace output is now
  configurable at built-time with the --with-machine-name flag or at
  run-time with the SCOREP_MACHINE_NAME measurement configuration
  variable.
- Full support to track the incurred OpenMP thread teams and utilizing
  the new generic threading records of OTF2.
- The Score-P internals were significantly refactored in order to
  increase flexibility to adapt to new programming paradigms and event
  sources.
- Please note that the feature 'selective tracing' was renamed to
  'selective recording' as it also applies to profiling.
- Please note that CUBE is a hard requirement when build Score-P from
  a tarball. This is due to the fact that we want to provide the user
  with 'scorep-score', that can't be build without the CUBE reader
  library available.

------------------- Released version 1.1 -----------------------------

- Rewind, a new event-trace recording mode for long-running
  experiments, triggered by user-instrumentation macros. Writes
  semantics information in OTF2 anchor file as rewind might affect
  analysis.
- ARM support (detection + compiler adapter).
- Metric service improvements. Support for per-process metrics and
  per-system-tree-class metrics.
- Support for OpenMP-task profiling and tracing alongside with
  improvements of the POMP adapter.
- Component separation: Score-P can now use pre-installed OTF2,
  OPARI2, and CUBE packages instead of the internal ones.
  - Removed dependency to external repository that was used by
    Score-P, OTF2, and OPARI2 in order to prevent version conflicts.
- Support for CUDA profiling and tracing.
- Easier experiment configuration via scorep-info which porvides a
  list of all measurement configuration variables.
- scorep-info also provides the improved configure-summary of the
  installation.
- Scoring of profile experiments via scorep-score (if configured with
  external CUBE) to prepare a filter for subsequent trace experiment.
- Documentation improvements.
- Numereous configure improvements. Let external libraries use
  generic configure options (tbc). Fixed portability issues.
- Numerous instrumenter improvements. All possible combinations of
  options supported.
- MPI profiling improvements.
- OpenMP nesting supported altough little tested.
- Several compiler-dependent OpenMP-related bugfixes.

------------------- Released version 1.0.2 ---------------------------

- Several instrumentation fixes:
  - Improvements for PDT Fortran instrumentation.
  - Improvements for C++ user instrumentation.
  - Return real failure if instrumentation is erroneous. Failures may
    went undetected previously.
  - Allow for out-of-place builds.
  - Provide correct parameter to SCOREP_USER_REGION_ENTER macro.

- Provide correct timestamp to OmpTaskCreate events.

- Fix invalid order of arguments provided to MpiCollectiveEnd events.

- Fix bug in parameter profiling.

- Enable SIONlib support, currently just for MPI applications. 

- Various fixes for the generated OpenMP region names:
  - Inner and outer blocks got different names.
  - Regions with the ordered clause got a special name.
  - All region names got it '@file:lno' appended, to make them distinguishable.

------------------- Released version 1.0.1 ---------------------------

- Renaming of the configure related variable LD_FLAGS_FOR_BUILD to
  LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD for consistency.

- Renaming of installed tool and options for consistency, i.e.
  changing underscores to dashes. Also, the --(no)openmp_support
  option changed to --(no)openmp.

- Improved linking on AIX systems.

- Robustness improvements when instrumenting with PDT.

- On x86 platforms, be more cautious using the tsc counter. If
  /proc/cpuinfo reports constant_tsc but not nonstop_tsc, then it is
  likely that the counter is unreliable.

- Improved configure summary.

- configure will not fail if -q or --silent is passed.
